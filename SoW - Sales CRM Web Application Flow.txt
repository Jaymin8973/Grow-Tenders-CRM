?? EMPLOYEE CRM SALES FLOW (ASSIGNED CUSTOMERS ONLY)
Step 1: Login & Dashboard Access
* Employee logs in using secure credentials.
* Lands on Personal Sales Dashboard.
* Dashboard shows:
o Assigned leads count
o Pending follow-ups
o Deals in progress
o Today’s tasks and reminders
o Leaderboard Status (Real-time)

Step 2: View Assigned Leads
* Employee opens “My Leads” section.
* Only leads assigned by the Manager or Super Admin are visible.
* Each lead shows:
o Customer name
o Contact details
o Lead source
o Current status
o Last interaction date

Step 3: Open Lead / Customer Profile
* Employee clicks on a lead.
* Full Customer Profile Page opens:
o Basic details (name, email, phone)
o Lead status and pipeline stage
o Activity timeline
o Notes and attachments
o Email history
This becomes the single source of truth for that customer.

Step 4: First Contact & Communication
An employee can:
* Call the customer (Manually)
* Send email directly from CRM
* Use predefined email templates
CRM automatically:
* Logs the communication
* Records date, time, and employee name
* Adds entry to the activity timeline

Step 5: Update Lead Status
After interaction, employee updates:
* Lead status (New ? Contacted ? Qualified ? Proposal ? Closed)
* Interest level
* Expected deal value (if applicable)
* Remarks or discussion notes
This update is instantly visible to:
* Manager
* Super Admin

Step 6: Schedule Follow-Ups
Employee schedules next action:
* Call
* Meeting
* Demo
* Reminder
CRM:
* Sends reminder notifications
* Flags overdue follow-ups
* Escalates if follow-up is missed (based on rules)

Step 7: Convert Lead to Deal
Once the customer shows intent:
* Employee creates a Deal
* Assigns deal value and expected close date
* Moves deal through pipeline stages
Pipeline stages are predefined by the Super Admin.

Step 8: Ongoing Customer Management
Employee continues to:
* Add notes after every interaction
* Upload documents (proposal, invoice, agreement)
* Send follow-up emails
* Update deal progress
All activity remains chronologically logged.

Step 9: Deal Closure
When the deal is finalized:
* Employee marks deal as Won or Lost
* Adds closing remarks
* Uploads final documents if required
CRM records:
* Closure date
* Revenue value
* Conversion metrics

Step 10: Post-Sale or Account Handling
Depending on business rules:
* Customer may move to the Active Customer state
* Assigned for upsell, renewal, or support follow-ups
* Employee retains or releases ownership
